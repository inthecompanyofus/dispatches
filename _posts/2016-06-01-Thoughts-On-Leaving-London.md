#Thoughts on relocating to Amsterdam#

Hello world, so, I've finally finished a collection of chores, both online and offline, and am now finally ensconced in my new home, a 17th century house in the heart of Amsterdam. Top floor, spiral staircase, and the sound of happy tourists and locals alike floating up from the street  below. ( niewendjik, for those wishing to stalk).

So, it's a fairly big day, there's a collection of things launching today, that are supposed to help you, my dear internet firends, and to assist me. So in no particular order.

1. **Dispatches**, a blog for Southworth Industries, where I'll share updates on my businesses, my general thinking, mad ideas, and the usual ramablings of a bloghead.
2. **Yes, &..,** My micro-agency that is startup focussed, and designed to help startups with marketing, communciations, product, investment, strategy, partnerships and anythihg else they may need.
3. **Mokum** - Mokum, is a yiddish word for "Safe Haven or safe space" and as the Jewish diaspora fled from the barbaric fascism of Hitler, Amsterdam was named Mokum Aleph. This is a publishing experiment designed to champion, celebrate, connect & faciliate European Startups with an especial focus on Amsterdam.

So, that's all the work malarkey said and done, and of course, you can reach out to me via all the usual channels  if you want to know more about any of the aforementioned projects or services. 

Now, on to matters more personal and revealing. 

Many of you have been asking me why I left london, or why I moved to Amsterdam. 

Like many things, a broken heart, a need for change and an opportunity for reflection were the catalysts for a seismic shift. I've recently turned 35, found myself without a partner in crime, a flat up for renewal, and the looming EU referendum. In essence not enough reasons to stay in London, a few too many memories, and a need to get back to "Benjamin". 

After 5 years in London, I'd done eveything and more than I set out to achieve, I couldn't really see what else I was looking to do, in essence this little Cambridge Hobbit and wandered in to the smoke, founded a business, walked in and out of Number 10 Downing Street, did a bunch of great work, messed about with 3beards, was EIR at TechStars, consulted for BBC, Heineken, Publicis, made a hundred thousand friends, and was still not staisfied. I also know how stupid that sounds. 

Therein lies the crux, my lack of satisfaction both with myself, my love life, my future and London  was beginning to drain on me. After a rough winter where my depression was particuarly unhelpful, and a few too many "nights of the dark soul", crying, and generally trying to "maintain", I'd had enough, a change was gonna come. 

I've been very lucky to travel the world, first with my family as my Father went on speaking & book tours (he worked, Mum & I had holidays ) and later for myself. One of the places that always felt "good" was Amsterdam. 

A city of 800k people, 900k bikes, 14million tourists, and a society of tolerance, saftey and respect appealed to me. 

So far, I've been immensely happy with my decision, and it's been made incredibly easy & realtively painless thanks to the unwavering friendship of Graham Bates, and a few London characters also deciding to take the leap. ( Eric & Guy)

Of course, there are many of you whom I miss, and sometimes I can feel that tugging on my heart strings, but most of the time I look to the future with renewed and regrown optimism, a chance for a different sort of success, a sucess in the eyes of myself, not for anyone else. I'll not be giving up work, or projects anytime soon, but I am focussing more on my music, trying to write more, and hope to start painting again very soon.

I'm still drinking too much, smoking, not getting enough excercise, sitting on the interenet too long but I am sleeping again, I'm not consumed by thoughts of inadequacy, or charlartanism, nor annoyed by the bullshit merchants sellling nothingness.

 In essence, I found my peace alongside the canals, admidst the bikes and terraces, watching the boats, hearing the birds, breathing noticably cleaner air, and re-orientating my internal compass to a different pole of success. 

I'll let you know how I get on. 

If you're ever in Amsterdam, drop me a line on twitter and let's talk.
